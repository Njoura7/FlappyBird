# FlappyBird
The famous game Flappy bird built with C#, starting with the form which basically contains 4 pictures (bird, floor, upper and down obstacle) and then gowing through the control of the bird (gravity, speed, the rules of the game(the bird must not touch any of the floor nor the down and upper obstacle))
# downloading methodes
in this project I tried to upload the upload the project with two different methodes (using th git bash command, and uploading the files by copying and pasting them directly )
*the second method might be easier but the first one is more efficent since github can't handle multiple files uploaded at once
